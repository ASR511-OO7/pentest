 Finding interesting files on a system thanks to a LFI previously found on the target.    

 - **web/versionchecker.sh**

   - and much more...
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
  
 - **web/cors/cors.py**
   - Multi-threaded script looking for some permissive CORS, taking a list of urls or domains in input  
   *Example of command:*  
   ```cors.py -f urls.txt```

 - <a id="git"></a>**git.sh**
   - Small bash script providing the following information about a web exposed git repository (even if no traversal dir):
     - Dates of last commits on each branch
     - Highlights directory traversal
     - Highlights if remote url can be accessed (may provide juicy info like user:password@github.com)

   ```git.sh -u http://monsite.com/.git/```

## PRIVILEGE ESCALATION  
  
 - **windows/privesc.bat** - Custom privesc script for windows using accesschk.exe (needed to be uploaded in the same time, check [sysinternals](https://technet.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sysinternals/bb842062)).  
 - **windows/wmic_info.bat** - Relevant information thanks to the WMI command-line utility.
 - **windows/win_user_add.c** - Add Windows user to local group Administrators.

## EXPLOITS  
  
 - **egg_hunter.c** - A 18 bytes Egg-Hunter shellcode ([https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41909/](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41909/))

## NETWORK  
  
 - **mitm/phishing.sh** - Launches an MITM attack and redirecting a specific domain to our phising web page.
 - **[mitm.sh](https://github.com/phackt/mitm)**  *(with [Mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy)) - has it's own repo*  
 A custom proxy that aims at stripping all HTTPS web page links and keeping unsecure connection with the proxy: VICTIM <-- **HTTP** --> MITMPROXY <-- **HTTPS** --> WEBSITE.  
 It works for any websites with at least one insecure page (which reliably means HSTS is not used for the current domain).  
 You can control and do whatever you want with the trafic thanks to custom **Python scripts**.  
  
## DEV  

 - **urls/uniqurls.py** - keep only unique urls (for each FQDNs, keeping the unique combinations of GET parameters)
 - **bruteforce/java/**
 - **bruteforce/javascript/** - Bruteforce algorithms with permutations and fixed position characters.  
 - **shell/lin_shell_bind_tcp.c** - /bin/sh TCP bind shell.
 - **shell/lin_reverse_tcp_shell.c** - /bin/sh TCP reverse shell.
 - **shell/uid_gid_root_shell.c** - setreuid/setregid root /bin/sh shell.
